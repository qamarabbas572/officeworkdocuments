Upgrading GitLab-CE (server) -- https://git.rolustech.com
1. Must perform during off office hours and completely go through the release notes for each upgrade version in the supported path. 

2. Add repo & keys for GitLab and verify it is working, run apt-get update after adding.

Complete script:
curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.deb.sh | sudo bash

3. Recommended to take Complete instance snapshot/backup before upgrading.

( Note: A Proxmox snapshot took about 3 hours and 30 minutes for 124GB occupied space(in case of .tar.lzo), out of which instance suspended time(downtime) was nearly 20 minutes. Rest of the time was consumed by rsync.
However, downtime can vairy depending on disk type or instance etc., it may have been upto 2.5 hours in case of a VM.  )

4. Block new jobs (runners, CI/CD etc):

- vi /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
Append:
nginx['custom_gitlab_server_config'] = "location ^~ /api/v4/jobs/request {\n deny all;\n return 503;\n}\n"
- gitlab-ctl reconfigure

5. Background migrations:

Must wait until all background migrations are completed, before each upgrade.
( Note: Just for an estimate, it took about 40 minutes for 7 migrations to complete. )

6. Follow the official upgrade path and commands preferring automated installations/upgrades:
For example, https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/toolbox/upgrade-path/?current=14.9.3&auto=true&edition=ce

7. Unblock jobs/runners:
Once final upgrade & migrations are complete, don't forget to unblock new jobs by erasing below line:
nginx['custom_gitlab_server_config'] = "location ^~ /api/v4/jobs/request {\n deny all;\n return 503;\n}\n"

Then run: gitlab-ctl reconfigure

8. gitlab-runners:
Upgrade gitlab-runners to the same or latest version for better compatibility, also restart gitlab-runner.service.
In our case, CentOS7:  
- gitlab-runner --version
- yum update
- yum info gitlab-runner
- yum install gitlab-runner
- systemctl restart gitlab-runner.service

Then verify active runners on GitLab

9. Final step:
Take a backup/snapshot of the latest GitLab instance.

10. Optional steps:
As GitLab package takes auto backups every time on upgrading, if needed to Skip backups in case of a minor version change, to save time:
touch /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-backup
